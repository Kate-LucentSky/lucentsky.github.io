    <p>
        Lucent Sky AVM requires an application to be buildable and compilable before it be can analyzed. This article demonstrates how to identify build and compilation errors in a web application, before submitting it to Lucent Sky AVM for analysis. It also outlines steps that might help resolve these errors.

        Many integrated development environments (IDEs) are capable of building a web application, including its classes and webpages, and identify any build and compilation error, such as invalid syntax or missing files and libraries. A benefit of taking this approach is that it will also ensure the application is in a structure that's supported by Lucent Sky AVM. The steps below outline this approach:
    </p>

    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Open the web application or website in Visual Studio</strong> - In the <strong>File</strong> menu, select <strong>Open</strong>, then select either <strong>Project/Solution</strong> or <strong>Web Site</strong>. In the dialog box, choose the root directory or project file of the legacy website, then click Open.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Build the web application</strong>– If it's a website, skip this step. In <strong>Solution Explorer</strong>, right-click on the web application, then select <strong>Build Solution</strong> in the contextual menu. Verify that no error occurred during the build process. If file not found errors occur during the publication, follow either step 2(a) or 2(b):
            <ol type="a">
                <li>
                    Locate the missing User Control or file, and place it in the location indicated by the error message.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove the Web Form (.aspx) that's causing the error, if this's no longer used. For other errors, resolving them according to the application requirement. Repeat this step until there're no more errors.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Publish the web application</strong> - In <strong>Solution Explorer</strong>, right-click on the web application project, then select <strong>Publish...</strong> in the contextual menu. For <strong>Target Location</strong>, choose a temporary location to publish the legacy website to. Then click <strong>OK</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Verify the website is publishable</strong> - Verify that no error occurred during the publication process. Once the publication has completed successfully, the status bar should display the message <strong>Publish succeeded</strong>. If file not found errors occur during the publication, follow either step 4(a) or 4(b):
            <ol type="a">
                <li>
                    Locate the missing User Control or file, and place it in the location indicated by the error message.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove the Web Form (.aspx) that's causing the error, if this's no longer used. For other errors, resolving them according to the application requirement. Repeat this step until there're no more errors. Publish the website again by starting at step 3.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Package the web application for analysis</strong> - In <strong>File Explorer</strong>, browse to the root directory of the website. Select all files, right-click, select <strong>Send to</strong>, then select <strong>Compressed (zipped) folder</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Start a scan of the web application or website</strong> - In Lucent Sky AVM Web UI, create a new scan and use the zip file created in step 5 as <strong>Source Code Archive</strong>.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="java">
        Java
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Verify the web application is buildable</strong> - In the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> window, right-click on the project and select <strong>Build Project</strong>. Then, right-click on the project and select <strong>Validate</strong>. Make revisions to the source code as necessary to correct for any errors in compilation or validation that occur.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Verify all referenced JAR files will be exported</strong> - In the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> window, right-click on the project, and select <strong>Properties</strong>, then select <strong>Java Build Path</strong>, then the <strong>Order and Export</strong> tab. Ensure that every JAR dependency referenced by the application is selected, so that these libraries will be placed in the <strong>WEB-INF\lib</strong> directory in the WAR file created in the next step.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Export the .war file</strong> - In the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> window, right-click on the project and select <strong>Export</strong>. Check the <strong>Export</strong> source files box, then select a name for the project and a destination to which it will be saved.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Verify the exported .war file</strong> - Rename the extension of the WAR file from .war to .zip. Open the .zip file and verify that the directory <strong>WEB-INF\lib</strong> contains the project's JAR dependencies, and that the directory <strong>WEB-INF\classes</strong> contains Java source files, not just .class files.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Start a scan of the web application</strong> - In Lucent Sky AVM Web UI, create a new scan and use the .zip file created in step 4 as <strong>Source Code Archive</strong>.
        </li>
    </ol>
